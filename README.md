# Gender Disparities in Sentencing and Recidivism Analysis

## Overview

This project investigates whether gender plays a statistically significant role in sentencing length and recidivism rates among parolees. The analysis is based on a cleaned and filtered version of a dataset containing charge descriptions, sentence durations, and recidivism outcomes.

## Objectives

- Determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in **sentence length** between male and female parolees.
- Assess the **recidivism rates** by gender and evaluate whether the differences are meaningful.
- Explore whether the distribution of **charge types** contributes to the observed differences in outcomes.
- Provide statistical justification for whether classification systems (e.g., labeling individuals as aggressive) are predictive or fair.
